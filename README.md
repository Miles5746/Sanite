# A Blox Fruits Fruit Farmer Called Sanite.
It Auto Server Hops, until it finds a fruit, where it either Tweens to, or, if eligible uses it's special mechanics to instantly grab it.
You will need to put the script in your executors auto-execute.

# When is a fruit eligible to instant pickup?
When it is dropped by a player. If it is just spawned or found with fruit radars, it will Tween/fly.

# Is it keyless?
For now... When it improves it won't be tho

# What if my executor is really bad?
Don't worry! If your executor Crashes (Looking at you hydrogen ):<), I created an optional python script to automaticly detect when roblox crashes and rejoin blox fruits.
There is a seperate one for Macos and Windows, Obviously not Linux. run it with python3, I am not going deep into that though, there will probely be a tutorial on youtube on how to run
python scripts.
